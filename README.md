SimpleToolsForU - OfflineTunes
## SimpleToolsForU
A project established by my friend Sagi Bar Yosef. We divided the work between us and this application was built and designed by me
## Main Idea
The application will add the user's favorite songs from YouTube manually and automatically download them while the user can listen. The application tries to prevent cases of not loading a tune in the case of inaccessibility to the Internet.
## Requirements:
* Python 3.10.1
* EEL library
* Youtube_DL [with a bit changes inside]
